  title: What is Cheerleading?
  description: |
    Cheerleading is an intense team sport where each team competes on a 9-run sprung floor for two and half minutes.

    Each routine is made up of three major components: stunting, tumbling and chant.
  items:
    - title: Stunting

        This is the bread and butter of a cheerleading routine. It takes up the majority of the time and is worth the most points. A single stunt is made up of one flyer and one to three bases. They are often chained together to form smooth sequences or conducted simultaneously by multiple groups. When groups connect while they are in a stunt it becomes a pyramid and allows for more difficult stunts to be performed.
    - title: Tumbling

        Tumbling is weaved inbetween stunting and is sometimes used as a transition but every routine has a dedicated tumble section. Points are awarded for having majority tumbling which means that most of the team performs a certain skill and for specailty tumbling passes made up of multiple skills.
    - title: Chant

        The chant section is unique to each university and often goes at the start of the routine but can be placed anywhere. The music stops during chant and the entire team attempts to get the audience to join in with them. Mixed in with chant is a dash of tumbling and stunting.
